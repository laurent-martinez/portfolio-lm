I have a strong foundation in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and React, and I am always eager to learn and expand my skill set. I enjoy the process of taking a design and bringing it to life on the web, ensuring that the final product is visually appealing, responsive, and easy to use. When I'm not coding, you can find creating artwork with Midjourney or working on my projects."
