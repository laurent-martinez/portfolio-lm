I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am always eager to learn and expand my skill set. As a front-end developer, I enjoy the process of taking a design and bringing it to life on the web, ensuring that the final product is visually appealing, responsive, and easy to use. When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with new technologies or designing my own projects."
